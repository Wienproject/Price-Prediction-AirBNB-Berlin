## Background Information 

Berlin is one of the most favourable city to visit in Europe. There are lot of tourist attractions , not only for adults, but also for children. AirBNB want therefore expanding business by targeting not only family segment, but also groups (each includes 3 people or more). Assuming that, family/group spend more than solo traveler, it is possibly good chance to bring company more capital. it is an excitement and real good opportunity as well to figure out more about it.

## Problem Statement

In order to optimize the business expansion process, it is a bigger size of accommodation needed to fulfil long holiday school. At least an entire room of apartment is demanded to fulfil this criteria. Entire Houses for Holiday Staycation are better and more suitable for modern big families, meanwhile for smaller families/groups, the entire apartment should be fine.

## Business Question

- In which areas are the most potential to  expand this business category?
- Are some features having impacts to the accommodation price?
- Which type of room are most to be found in each neighbourhood group?
- Is the neighbourhood with the most expensive accommodation located in the same as its neighbourhood group (district) ?
- Does the sightseeing area have impact on the price and accommodations distribution?


## Business Goals

- Giving advices to our business development team to grow our business in favorable area hence with good price.
- Building a model to suggest accommodation price in best suitable district (neighbourhood group) for upcoming accommodation.
